            <p  style="line-height: 30px;">
              I'm graduate student currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Florida. I bring with me a robust foundation as a software developer, well-versed in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Openshift. My journey in technology is a continuous quest for new challenges, driven by curiosity, and a commitment to expanding my skill set.
